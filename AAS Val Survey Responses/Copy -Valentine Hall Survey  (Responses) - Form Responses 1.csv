Meat should be considered a bonus on top of our vegan and vegetarian foundation! Buy fish that people actually eat! The salmon was great; no one eats the bargain bin fish. Better to have fish people like a couple times a week than to have bad fish every day. The menu quite honestly doesn't reflect where Amherst students come from, or the tastes of this younger generation. People are not interested in burgers and pizza and chicken tenders! These are foods that are not good for people's bodies or the environment. We need simple healthy food that are well seasoned. I personally love a good seasoned butternut squash, or black beans. The indian food is pretty good too.","The biggest problem facing Val is stylistic direction. If we kept the same ingredients and simply changed the recipes and recipe names, we could get pretty far. The following foods are ""not in"" these days: lasagna, burgers, DIRTY rice, blackened catfish, fried stuff. People want simple, EXCITEDLY SEASON healthy foods. The Mount Holyoke dining hall is an example of this. If Val were a restaurant in a free marketplace, say any of the major US cities, it would have to shutdown immediately!!!

Additionally, I have noticed that on some days there is jasmine rice at breakfast but on other days it is this Occidental long grain rice. Could Val please switch to serving only Jasmine? The other kind of rice is unappetizing and it really makes a difference to what I eat at breakfast what kind of rice is used. Finally, for noodle nights (Pho, ramen), I think the food would benefit extremely if Val consulted UMass as to how they handle their soup and noodles.
