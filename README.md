# Val-Dining-23-24
Here is a summary of the files and sources used for my Tableau projects

## Meal Swipe
Monthly compost data (month, tons, pounds, and meal swipe counts) from Oct 22' to Mar 24' can be found in "compost2224.xlsx" and weekly compost data from Jan to Mar 24' can be found in "compost24.xlsx". 

The raw compost data for this is in "compost_22-24.csv" and "compost_24.csv" respectively. 

The raw meal swipe data is in "meal_swipes_22-24.csv" and "meal_swipes_spring24.csv" respectively.

The .qmd files contail the wrangling used for tabeleau.

## PFG FY23
"food_emissions.xlsx" contains the sample of ~200 PFG purchases used in the tableau analysis. 

The raw PFG report of ~1800 purchases is in "food_2023.xlsx". 

## AAS Val Survey Responses
The AAS Val Satisfaction survey which collected responses from Dec 22' to Feb 23' can be found in the original excel "Copy -Valentine Hall Survey  (Responses) - Form Responses 1.xlsx".

"cleaned_responses.xlsx" contains only the fish-related responses.

## NetMenu
This contains an unfinished/failed(?) attempt to geocode the locations of the list of NetMenu vendors. This was motivated by a desire to see how local the vendors were. This failed largely because the "vendors" listed in NetMenu are large manufacturers and we didn't have access to the specific vendors which could be found in the distributor reports for each manufacturer.

Regardless, the ~30 NetMenu vendors are found in "Vendor Certifications.xlsx" and the addresses I found are in "addresses.xlsx". "Vendor Certification wrangling.qmd" contains my code.
